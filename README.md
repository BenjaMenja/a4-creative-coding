Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- the instructions you present in the website should be clear enough to use the application, but if you feel any need to provide additional instructions please do so here.

I have created an online simple drawing pad that lets the user draw on a canvas. They are given options for color, transparency, background color, and brush size. One of the big difficulties when creating the application was storing and using the cursor's current position relative to the canvas. While the actual storing wasn't too difficult, making the brush draw at the correct position on the cursor was more difficult than anticipated.
